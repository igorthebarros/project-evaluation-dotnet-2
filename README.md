# üê≥ .NET Order API ‚Äî Dockerized Microservice

A simple .NET API project for order management, using Docker, Entity Framework Core, and Swagger for API exploration.

---

## üì¶ Running with Docker Compose

Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the project root folder.
3. Run this command:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will download dependencies, build the containers, and start the services.

---

## üíæ Applying EF Core Migrations

Once the container is running, open a terminal and execute:

```bash
docker exec -it {your-api-container-name} dotnet ef database update
```

Replace `{your-api-container-name}` with the name of your running API container.

This will apply any pending Entity Framework Core migrations to your database.

---

## üîç Accessing Swagger UI

After your container is up and running, open this URL in your browser:

```
http://localhost:{your_port}/swagger
```

Example:
```
http://localhost:5000/swagger
```

This will open the Swagger page where you can explore and test your endpoints.

## üì¨ Sample Data for `/api/v1/order/create`

When using Swagger or Postman to test your API, send a POST request to:

```
